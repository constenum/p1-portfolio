## Details for teaching team
This project was created using Bootstrap and includes a fixed navbar and sticky footer. The background image is from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com). I check index.html using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and I checked styles.css using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This site was viewed on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using an Apple MacBook Pro. Normalize.css was added to provide consistency between browsers.
